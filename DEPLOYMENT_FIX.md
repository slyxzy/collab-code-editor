# Deployed Version Fix

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Session Saving Issues**
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved API URL detection for production
- Added fallback transport methods for WebSocket connections
- Enhanced debugging with console logs

### 2. **User Count Display Issues**
- Fixed socket connection handling for deployed environments
- Added connection status indicators
- Improved user state management
- Added fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

### 3. **CORS Configuration**
- Updated CORS to handle both with and without trailing slash
- Added proper Netlify domain configuration

## Steps to Deploy the Fix

### For Netlify (Frontend):
1. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to Site Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com`
   - Replace `your-render-backend-url` with your actual Render backend URL

2. **Redeploy**:
   - Push your changes to your connected Git repository
   - Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy

### For Render (Backend):
1. **Redeploy**:
   - Push your changes to your connected Git repository
   - Render will automatically rebuild and redeploy

## Testing the Fix

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open your deployed site
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check Console tab for:
   - "Connecting to: [your-backend-url]"
   - "Connected to server"
   - "Session initialized: [data]"
   - "Users updated: [array]"

### Test Session Saving:
1. Type some code in the editor
2. Click "Save" button
3. Should see "Saving..." → "Saved ✓"
4. Check console for "Session saved successfully"

### Test User Count:
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows to your site
2. User count should increase
3. Close tabs - count should decrease
4. Check console for "Users updated" messages

## Troubleshooting

### If Session Saving Still Fails:
- Check console for error messages
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set correctly
- Check Render logs for backend errors

### If User Count Doesn't Work:
- Check console for connection errors
- Verify WebSocket connection is established
- Check if Render supports WebSocket connections

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS errors**: Backend CORS is now properly configured
2. **Connection timeout**: Added fallback to polling transport
3. **API not found**: Environment variable should point to your Render URL

## Environment Variables Summary

### Netlify (Frontend):
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com
```

### Render (Backend):
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```
(No additional environment variables needed for basic functionality)
